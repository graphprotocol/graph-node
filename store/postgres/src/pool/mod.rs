    ///     perform a blocking operation. This includes all accesses to the

    ///     cause problems with `Future` combinators (including but not limited
    ///     to select, timeout, and FuturesUnordered) and problems with
    ///     executors/runtimes. This method moves the database work onto another
    ///     thread in a way which does not block `Future::poll`.
    ///
    ///   * Limit the total number of connections. Because the supplied closure
    ///     takes a reference, we know the scope of the usage of all entity
    ///     connections and can limit their use in a non-blocking way.
    ///
    /// # Cancellation
    ///   The normal pattern for futures in Rust is drop to cancel. Once we
    ///   spawn the database work in a thread though, this expectation no longer
    ///   holds because the spawned task is the independent of this future. So,
    ///   this method provides a cancel token which indicates that the `Future`
    ///   has been dropped. This isn't *quite* as good as drop on cancel,
    ///   because a drop on cancel can do things like cancel http requests that
    ///   are in flight, but checking for cancel periodically is a significant
    ///   improvement.
    ///
    ///   The implementation of the supplied closure should check for cancel
    ///   between every operation that is potentially blocking. This includes
    ///   any method which may interact with the database. The check can be
    ///   conveniently written as `token.check_cancel()?;`. It is low overhead
    ///   to check for cancel, so when in doubt it is better to have too many
    ///   checks than too few.
    ///
    /// # Panics:
    ///   * This task will panic if the supplied closure panics
    ///   * This task will panic if the supplied closure returns Err(Cancelled)
    ///     when the supplied cancel token is not cancelled.

    /// Execute a closure with a connection to the database.
    ///
    /// # API
    ///   The API of using a closure to bound the usage of the connection serves several
    ///   purposes:
    ///
    ///   * Moves blocking database access out of the `Future::poll`. Within
    ///     `Future::poll` (which includes all `async` methods) it is illegal to
    ///     perform a blocking operation. This includes all accesses to the
    ///     database, acquiring of locks, etc. Calling a blocking operation can
    ///     cause problems with `Future` combinators (including but not limited
    ///     to select, timeout, and FuturesUnordered) and problems with
    ///     executors/runtimes. This method moves the database work onto another
    ///     thread in a way which does not block `Future::poll`.
    ///
    ///   * Limit the total number of connections. Because the supplied closure
    ///     takes a reference, we know the scope of the usage of all entity
    ///     connections and can limit their use in a non-blocking way.
    ///
    /// # Cancellation
    ///   The normal pattern for futures in Rust is drop to cancel. Once we
    ///   spawn the database work in a thread though, this expectation no longer
    ///   holds because the spawned task is the independent of this future. So,
    ///   this method provides a cancel token which indicates that the `Future`
    ///   has been dropped. This isn't *quite* as good as drop on cancel,
    ///   because a drop on cancel can do things like cancel http requests that
    ///   are in flight, but checking for cancel periodically is a significant
    ///   improvement.
    ///
    ///   The implementation of the supplied closure should check for cancel
    ///   between every operation that is potentially blocking. This includes
    ///   any method which may interact with the database. The check can be
    ///   conveniently written as `token.check_cancel()?;`. It is low overhead
    ///   to check for cancel, so when in doubt it is better to have too many
    ///   checks than too few.
    ///
    /// # Panics:
    ///   * This task will panic if the supplied closure panics
    ///   * This task will panic if the supplied closure returns Err(Cancelled)
    ///     when the supplied cancel token is not cancelled.
