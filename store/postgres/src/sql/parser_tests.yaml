# Test cases for the SQL parser. Each test case has the following fields:
#   name : an optional name for error messages
#   sql  : the SQL query to parse
#   ok   : the expected rewritten query
#   err  : a part of the error message if parsing should fail
# Of course, only one of ok and err can be specified
