//! Helpers for using advisory locks. We centralize all use of these locks
//! in this module to make it easier to see what they are used for.
//!
//! The [Postgres
//! documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html#ADVISORY-LOCKS)
//! has more details on advisory locks.
//!
//! We use the following 64 bit locks:
//!   * 1,2: to synchronize on migratons
//!
//! We use the following 2x 32-bit locks
//!   * 1, n: to lock copying of the deployment with id n in the destination
//!           shard
//!   * 2, n: to lock the deployment with id n to make sure only one write
//!           happens to it
