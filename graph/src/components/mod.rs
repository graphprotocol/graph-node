//! The Graph network nodes are internally structured as a layers of reusable
//! components with non-blocking communication, with each component having a
//! corresponding trait defining it's interface.
//!
//! As examples of components, at the top layer component there is the GraphQL
//! server which interacts with clients, and at the lowest layer we have data
//! sources that interact with storage backends.
//!
//! The layers are not well defined, but it's expected that a higher-level
//! component will make requests for a lower-level component to respond, and
//! that a lower-level component will send events to interested higher-level
//! components when it's state changes.
//!
//! A request/response interaction between C1 and C2 is made by C1 requiring an
//! `Arc<C2>` in it's constructor and then calling the functions defined on C2.
//!
//! Event-based interactions propagate changes in the underlining data upwards
//! in the component graph, with low level components generating event streams
//! based on changes in external systems, mid level components transforming
//! these streams and high level components finally consuming the received
//! events.
//!
//! These events are communicated through sinks and streams (typically senders
//! and receivers of channels), which are managed by long-running Tokio tasks.
//! Each component may have an internal task for handling input events and
//! sending out output events, and the "dumb pipes" that plug together components
//! are tasks that send out events in the order that they are received.
//!
//! A component declares it's inputs and outputs by having `EventConsumer<U>` and
//! `EventProducer<T>` traits as supertraits.
//!
//! Components should use the helper functions in this module (e.g. `forward`)
//! that define common operations on event streams, facilitating the
//! configuration of component graphs.
