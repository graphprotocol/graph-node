# Pin to serde_json 1.0.25. Newer releases use ryu instead of dtoa for floating
# point (de)serialization, which caused test failures. What may be happening
# here is that we write entities to the store with f32 values and then what
# comes back when deserializing is not f32 and so serde_json cannot match float
# values to our Value::Float(f32) variant. Would have to investigate further how
# we can fix this.
