## Overview

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is a decentralized protocol that organizes and distributes blockchain data across the leading Web3 networks. A key component of The Graph's tech stack is Graph Node.

Before using `graph-node,` it is highly recommended that you read the [official Graph documentation](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/subgraphs/quick-start/) to understand Subgraphs, which are the central mechanism for extracting and organizing blockchain data.

This guide is for:

1. Subgraph developers who want to run `graph-node` locally to test their Subgraphs during development
2. Contributors who want to add features or fix bugs to `graph-node` itself

## Running `graph-node` from Docker images

For subgraph developers, it is highly recommended to use prebuilt Docker
images to set up a local `graph-node` environment. Please read [these
instructions](./docker/README.md) to learn how to do that.

## Running `graph-node` from source

This is usually only needed for developers who want to contribute to `graph-node`.

### Prerequisites

To build and run this project, you need to have the following installed on your system:

- Rust (latest stable): Follow [How to install
  Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html). Run `rustup install
stable` in _this directory_ to make sure all required components are
  installed. The `graph-node` code assumes that the latest available
  `stable` compiler is used.
- PostgreSQL: [PostgreSQL Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) lists
  downloads for almost all operating systems.
  - For OSX: We highly recommend [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com/).
  - For Linux: Use the Postgres version that comes with the distribution.
- IPFS: [Installing IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/install/)
- Protobuf Compiler: [Installing Protobuf](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/)

For Ethereum network data, you can either run your own Ethereum node or use an Ethereum node provider of your choice.

### Create a database

Once Postgres is running, you need to issue the following commands to create a database
and configure it for use with `graph-node`.

The name of the `SUPERUSER` depends on your installation, but is usually `postgres` or your username.

```bash
psql -U <SUPERUSER> <<EOF
create user graph with password '<password>';
create database "graph-node" with owner=graph template=template0 encoding='UTF8' locale='C';
create extension pg_trgm;
create extension btree_gist;
create extension postgres_fdw;
grant usage on foreign data wrapper postgres_fdw to graph;
EOF
```

For convenience, set the connection string to the database in an environment
variable, and save it, e.g., in `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
export POSTGRES_URL=postgresql://graph:<password>@localhost:5432/graph-node
```

Use the `POSTGRES_URL` from above to have `graph-node` connect to the
database. If you ever need to manually inspect the contents of your
database, you can do that by running `psql $POSTGRES_URL`. Running this
command is also a convenient way to check that the database is up and
running and that the connection string is correct.

### Build and Run `graph-node`

Clone this repository and run this command at the root of the repository:

```bash
export GRAPH_LOG=debug
cargo run -p graph-node --release -- \
  --postgres-url $POSTGRES_URL \
  --ethereum-rpc NETWORK_NAME:[CAPABILITIES]:URL \
  --ipfs 127.0.0.1:5001
```

The argument for `--ethereum-rpc` contains a network name (e.g. `mainnet`) and
a list of provider capabilities (e.g. `archive,traces`). The URL is the address
of the Ethereum node you want to connect to, usually a `https` URL, so that the
entire argument might be `mainnet:archive,traces:https://provider.io/some/path`.

When `graph-node` starts, it prints the various ports that it is listening on.
The most important of these is the GraphQL HTTP server, which by default
is at `http://localhost:8000`. You can use routes like `/subgraphs/name/<subgraph-name>`
and `/subgraphs/id/<IPFS hash>` to query subgraphs once you have deployed them.

### Deploying a Subgraph

Follow the [Subgraph deployment
guide](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/subgraphs/developing/introduction/).
After setting up `graph-cli` as described, you can deploy a Subgraph to your
local Graph Node instance.

### Advanced Configuration

The command line arguments generally are all that is needed to run a
`graph-node` instance. For advanced uses, various aspects of `graph-node`
can further be configured through [environment
variables](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/blob/master/docs/environment-variables.md).

Very large `graph-node` instances can also be configured using a
[configuration file](./docs/config.md) That is usually only necessary when
the `graph-node` needs to connect to multiple chains or if the work of
indexing and querying needs to be split across [multiple databases](./docs/config.md).
