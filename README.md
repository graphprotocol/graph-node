# Graph Node

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/graphprotocol/graph-node.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/graphprotocol/graph-node)
[![Getting Started Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-getting--started-brightgreen.svg)](docs/getting-started.md)

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is a protocol for building decentralized applications quickly on Ethereum and IPFS using GraphQL.

Graph Node is an open source Rust implementation that event-sources the Ethereum blockchain to deterministically update a datastore which can be queried via the GraphQL endpoint.

For detailed instructions and more context check out the [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting-started.md).

_Note: this project is heavily WIP and until it reaches v1.0 the API is subject to change in breaking ways without notice._

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

To build and run this project you need
to have the following installed on your system:

- Rust (latest stable) - [How to install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html)
- PostgreSQL â€“ [PostgreSQL Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- IPFS â€“ [Installing IPFS](https://ipfs.io/docs/install/)

For Ethereum network data you can either run a local node or use Infura.io:

- Local node â€“ [Installing and running Ethereum node](https://ethereum.gitbooks.io/frontier-guide/content/getting_a_client.html)
- Infura infra â€“ [Infura.io](https://infura.io/)

### Running a local Graph Node

This is a quick example to get you up and running, it uses a [subgraph for ENS](https://github.com/graphprotocol/ens-subgraph) that we built as a reference.
                                                   
1. Install IPFS and run `ipfs init` followed by `ipfs daemon`
2. Install PostgreSQL and run `initdb -D .postgres` followed by `createdb graph-node`
3. If using Ubuntu, you may need to install additional packages:
   - `sudo apt-get install -y clang libpq-dev libssl-dev pkg-config`
4. Clone https://github.com/graphprotocol/ens-subgraph, install dependencies and generate types for contract ABIs:

```
yarn install
yarn codegen
```

5. Clone https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node and run `cargo build`

Once you have all the dependencies set up you can run the following:

```
cargo run -p graph-node --release -- \
  --postgres-url postgresql://USERNAME[:PASSWORD]@localhost:5432/graph-node \
  --ethereum-rpc mainnet:https://mainnet.infura.io/ \
  --ipfs 127.0.0.1:5001
```

Try your OS username as `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD`. The password might be optional, it depends on your setup.

This will also spin up a GraphiQL interface at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

6.  Back in your subgraph directory, run

```
yarn deploy --verbosity debug
```

in order to build and deploy your subgraph to the Graph Node. It should start indexing the subgraph immediately.

### Command-line interface

```
USAGE:
    graph-node
      --subgraph <IPFS_HASH>
      --ethereum-ipc <FILE>
        or --ethereum-rpc <URL>
        or --ethereum-ws <URL>
      --ipfs <HOST:PORT>
      --postgres-url <URL>

FLAGS:
        --debug      Enable debug logging
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
        --subgraph [<NAME>:]<IPFS_HASH>         Name (optional) and IPFS hash of the subgraph manifest
        --ethereum-ipc <NETWORK_NAME>:<FILE>    Ethereum network name (e.g. 'mainnet') and Ethereum IPC pipe path, separated by a ':'
        --ethereum-rpc <NETWORK_NAME>:<URL>     Ethereum network name (e.g. 'mainnet') and Ethereum RPC endpoint URL, separated by a ':'
        --ethereum-ws <NETWORK_NAME>:<URL>      Ethereum network name (e.g. 'mainnet') and Ethereum WebSocket endpoint URL, separated by a ':'
        --ipfs <HOST>:<PORT>                    HTTP address of an IPFS node
        --postgres-url <URL>                    Location of the Postgres database used for storing entities
```

### Environment Variables

The Graph supports the following environment variables:

```
THEGRAPH_SENTRY_URL (optional) â€” Activates error reporting using Sentry
```

## Project Layout

- `node` â€” A local Graph node.
- `graph` â€” A library providing traits for system components and types for
  common data.
- `core` â€” A library providing implementations for core components, used by all
  nodes.
- `datasource/ethereum` â€” A library with components for obtaining data from
  Ethereum.
- `graphql` â€” A GraphQL implementation with API schema generation,
  introspection and more.
- `mock` â€” A library providing mock implementations for all system components.
- `runtime/wasm` â€” A library for running WASM data extraction scripts.
- `server/http` â€” A library providing a GraphQL server over HTTP.
- `store/postgres` â€” A Postgres store with a GraphQL friendly interface
  and audit logs.
