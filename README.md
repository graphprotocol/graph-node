# Graph Node

[![Build Status](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/actions/workflows/ci.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)
[![Getting Started Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-getting--started-brightgreen.svg)](docs/getting-started.md)

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is a protocol for building decentralized applications (dApps) quickly on Ethereum and IPFS using GraphQL.

Graph Node is an open source Rust implementation that event sources the Ethereum blockchain to deterministically update a data store that can be queried via the GraphQL endpoint.

For detailed instructions and more context, check out the [Getting Started Guide](docs/getting-started.md).

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

To build and run this project you need to have the following installed on your system:

- Rust (latest stable) â€“ [How to install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html)
  - Note that `rustfmt`, which is part of the default Rust installation, is a build-time requirement.
- PostgreSQL â€“ [PostgreSQL Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- IPFS â€“ [Installing IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.io/install/)

For Ethereum network data, you can either run your own Ethereum node or use an Ethereum node provider of your choice.

### Running a Local Graph Node

This is a quick example to show a working Graph Node. It is a [subgraph for Gravatars](https://github.com/graphprotocol/example-subgraph).

1. Install IPFS and run `ipfs init` followed by `ipfs daemon`.
2. Install PostgreSQL and run `initdb -D .postgres` followed by `pg_ctl -D .postgres -l logfile start` and `createdb graph-node`.
3. If using Ubuntu, you may need to install additional packages:
   - `sudo apt-get install -y clang libpq-dev libssl-dev pkg-config`
4. In the terminal, clone https://github.com/graphprotocol/example-subgraph, and install dependencies and generate types for contract ABIs:

```
yarn
yarn codegen
```

5. In the terminal, clone https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node, and run `cargo build`.

Once you have all the dependencies set up, you can run the following:

```
cargo run -p graph-node --release -- \
  --postgres-url postgresql://USERNAME[:PASSWORD]@localhost:5432/graph-node \
  --ethereum-rpc NETWORK_NAME:[CAPABILITIES]:URL \
  --ipfs 127.0.0.1:5001
```

Try your OS username as `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD`. For details on setting
the connection string, check the [Postgres
documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING).
`graph-node` uses a few Postgres extensions. If the Postgres user with which
you run `graph-node` is a superuser, `graph-node` will enable these
extensions when it initalizes the database. If the Postgres user is not a
superuser, you will need to create the extensions manually since only
superusers are allowed to do that. To create them you need to connect as a
superuser, which in many installations is the `postgres` user:

```bash
    psql -q -X -U <SUPERUSER> graph-node <<EOF
create extension pg_trgm;
create extension pg_stat_statements;
create extension btree_gist;
create extension postgres_fdw;
grant usage on foreign data wrapper postgres_fdw to <USERNAME>;
EOF

```

This will also spin up a GraphiQL interface at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

6.  With this Gravatar example, to get the subgraph working locally run:

```
yarn create-local
```

Then you can deploy the subgraph:

```
yarn deploy-local
```

This will build and deploy the subgraph to the Graph Node. It should start indexing the subgraph immediately.

### Command-Line Interface

### Advanced Configuration

The command line arguments generally are all that is needed to run a
`graph-node` instance. For advanced uses, various aspects of `graph-node`
can further be configured through [environment
variables](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/blob/master/docs/environment-variables.md). Very
large `graph-node` instances can also split the work of querying and
indexing across [multiple databases](./docs/config.md).
