# The Graph Network Components

This repository contains the source code for the network components of The Graph.
Right now, this includes:

1. `thegraph-local-node`: A local-only The Graph node.
2. `thegraph`: A library providing traits for system components and types for common data.
3. `thegraph-core`: A library providing implementations for core components, used by all nodes.
4. `thegraph-hyper`: A library providing an implementation of the GraphQL server component
   based on Hyper.
5. `thegraph-mock`: A library providing mock implementations for all system components.

## Prerequisites

The network components of The Graph are written in Rust. In order to build and
run this project you need to have Rust installed on your system:

* [How to install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html)

## Getting Started

### Environment Variables

The Graph supports, and in some cases requires, the following environment variables:

```
THEGRAPH_SENTRY_URL (optional) â€” Activates error reporting using Sentry
```

### Running a local node

To build and run a local node from the root directory in this repository, simply run
```sh
cargo run -p thegraph-local-node
```

### Developing

While developing, a useful command to run in the background is this:
```sh
cargo watch                       \
    -x "test -- --test-threads=1" \
    -x check                      \
    -x "doc --no-deps"            \
    -x "fmt -all"
```
This will watch your source directory and continuously do the following on changes:

1. Build all packages in the workspace `target/`.
2. Generate docs for all packages in the workspace in `target/doc/`.
3. Automatically format all your source files.
