graph-node provides the following metrics via Prometheus endpoint on 8040 port by default:
- `deployment_block_processing_duration`
Measures **duration of block processing** for a subgraph deployment
- `deployment_block_trigger_count`
Measures the **number of triggers in each** block for a subgraph deployment
- `deployment_count` 
Counts the number of deployments currently being indexed by the graph-node.
- `deployment_eth_rpc_errors`
Counts **eth** **rpc request errors** for a subgraph deployment
- `deployment_eth_rpc_request_duration`
Measures **eth** **rpc request duration** for a subgraph deployment
- `deployment_failed`
Boolean gauge to indicate **whether the deployment has failed** (1 == failed)
- `deployment_handler_execution_time`
Measures the **execution time for handlers**
- `deployment_head`
Track the **head block number** for a deployment. Example:

```protobuf
deployment_head{deployment="QmaeWFYbPwmXEk7UuACmkqgPq2Pba5t2RYdJtEyvAUmrxg",network="mumbai",shard="primary"} 19509077
```

- `deployment_host_fn_execution_time`
Measures the **execution time for host functions**
