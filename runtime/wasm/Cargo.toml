# We would like to switch to upstream master once https://github.com/paritytech/ethabi/pull/145
# is merged.
# But, graph-patches also contains Jannis' https://github.com/paritytech/ethabi/pull/140 PR
# to ethabi. Which we believe will not get merged. For now, we shall deviate from ethabi,
# but long term we want to avoid forking off ethabi if possible
